# Wirefox - Networking API

Wirefox is a flexible, easy-to-use and no-nonsense networking library.

- Connection-oriented API
- Message-oriented delivery
- Peer-to-peer-style architecture, but also supports client-server model
- Supports both IPv4 & IPv6 out of the box
- Supports reliable delivery of messages
- Supports encryption, with automatic key exchange and forward secrecy
- Supports custom channels, to sort and sequence packets
- Supports LAN discovery, to detect game lobbies etc. on the local network

This library is under active development, and might not ready to be used in production. Regardless, I'd love to hear from you if you have any thoughts or concerns!
